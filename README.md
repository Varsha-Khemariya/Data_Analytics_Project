# Data_Analytics_Project
Imported HR data from Excel and transformed it using Power Query Editor (renamed columns, changed data types, filtered records).
Built a star schema data model with clear relationships between employee demographics and attrition metrics.
Created custom DAX measures for:
Attrition Rate
Average Age
Average Monthly Income
Average Years at Company
Designed visuals such as:
Donut chart for Attrition by Education
Bar charts for Job Role, Age Group, and Salary Slabs
Line chart to track Attrition over Years
Matrix visual to break down attrition by department and job roles
